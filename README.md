# reddit-fmf-deal-scraper (Work In Progress)

## Description

Script that scrapes /r/frugalmalefashion for new deals and notifies the user of said deals

## Goals / Idea

### Beginning Stages
1. Script will run by user manually
2. Find hot/top posts
3. Send a message to user's reddit inbox containing a list of titles of what the deal entails and a link to the website and/or code of the deal

### Future Implementations
* Automate script to run periodically
* Change script to comb through new posts if automated to run periodically
* Create filter or search specifications for deals to look for; type of wardrobe, cost, size, brand, etc.
* Option to send SMS text instead of a message to Reddit inbox (?)

## Utilized
* Python3
* PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
